# IT Test â€“ Quiz Web App

## Overview:
IT Test is a full-stack web application built with React on the frontend and Node.js on the backend. The app provides a quiz-style testing experience, where users can take IT-related quizzes and get immediate feedback. This project was created to improve my full-stack skills by combining interactive UI development with a basic backend server for handling quiz data.


## Features:
Quiz questions are dynamically rendered using React.
Users can select answers and submit quizzes.
Immediate scoring and feedback is shown after submission.
Backend built with Node.js, which handles serving quiz data and basic API routing.
